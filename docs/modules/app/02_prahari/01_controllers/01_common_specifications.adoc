== Introduction

=== Purpose

Prahari Engineering aims to integrate the hardware of weighing scale with the Merco Ecosystem of Kanilebettu Technologies, to provide a seamless data digitization process. The purpose of this document is to describe the technical and operational requirements for developing the system that meets the requirement for data digitization of measurement of weight.The weighing system shall integrate to various external scale or balance, of different capacities, but of the same class accuracy.


=== Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions

- Product Team
- Development Team (Hardware, Software)
- Testers
- PCB designer
- Consultants
- Business Owners


=== Project Scope

Digital weighing scales have been used in conjunction with an accounting software. The process has been limited to a wired system and a need for a trained resource to record the transaction. The inadequacy of this method has ensured a persistent use of paper documents to record and maintain the measured data. The goal of PRAHARI family system is to ensure a seamless integration of digitally recorded data to a tailor made accounting suite, while simultaneously eliminating the need for trained resources, spatially constrained devices or paper documentation.

The Prahari system can operate seamlessly without much manual intervention. Significant savings can be made by eliminating erroneous inputs and data duplication efforts. Remote collation of transaction data enables users to access reports from anywhere at any point in time. Prahari family devices are intended to be used independently and also in conjunction with the custom accounting software suite developed for Auction trade, wholesale and retail businesses.

==== Description and Priority

Weighing scales are divided based on Accuracy classes. Based on the Class, many other operational parameters are defined. PERC3S01 is designed to be **CLASS III** accuracy device. In India, IS:9281 is the prescribed standard. But it would be critical to adhere to US NIST Handbook 44 standard definition.


**Priority:**  *High*


==== **Functional Requirements**

Class III weighing scales are to conform to IS:9281 specifications listed below

**IS: 9281 Specifications** (Table 2 of Part 3)

=== Connect to Variety of Load Cells

==== Description and Priority

Various load cells are applicable for the given target market. It's imperative that PERC3S01, a Class III weighing system, is perfectly matched to the load cell to obtain accurate measurement. The target market for PERC3S01 is in the capacity range of 0~300 kg.

![Inline image](img/Types_of_load_cell.jpg)

The principle factor that affects accuracy is the ADC of PERC3S01. Analyzing the errors of load cell and ensuring reproducibility of measurement with accuracy is of great importance, which is the direct indication of long term stability of the weighing system. These two factors which dictates the quality of performance of a weighing system, derives from linearity, temperature influence and long term drift of electronics.


**Priority:** High



==== Functional Requirements


A good coupling between the weighing electronics and the load cell depends on the following parameters,

* **Excitation Technique**

    The sensor needs an accurate and a highly stable excitation source. Many pressure sensor designs use the same common reference for the excitation circuitry and the ADC for better accuracy, (around 1.5 - 2.5 mV/V).


* **Signal conditioning**

    The load cell signal output is extremely low, and hence, a stabilized amplification is needed to provide extremely high dc precision and noise performance at low frequency range. PERC3S01 is required to be precise, low drift and with auto - zero methods.


* **Signal Acquisition and Processing**

PERC3S01 must lean towards high resolution, along with low temperature and offset drifts suitable for Weighing scale application.




**IS:9281 Specifications** (Table 1 of Part 3)

For Class III, load cell specifications are given by IS 9281. PERC3S01 must be able to self align or be configurable to the connected load cell, which are within the regulated specifications.

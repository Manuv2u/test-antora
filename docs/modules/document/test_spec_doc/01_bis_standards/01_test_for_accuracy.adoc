Max Capacity Settings of the device = 100 kg
Verification scale interval, e =

No of verification scale intervals, n = Max/e

Class III

Max~Capacity~ = 100 kg

Maximum Permissible Error, MPE


n~minimum~ @ 100

stem:[ e = 100000 / 100 = 1000 ]

n~maximum~ = 10,000

stem:[ \alpha + e = 100000 / 10000 = 10 ]

e = 10 g



latexmath:[C = \alpha * \beta Y^{\gamma} + \epsilon]

n~maximum~ = 10,000

Minimum Capacity = 20 e = 100 g


Max~Capacity~ = 300 kg


latexmath:[e = 100000 / 100 = 1000]







Definitions:

. Actual Scale interval, *_d_*

 the difference between two consecutive indicated values, for digital indication. The smallest change that can be observed.

. Verification scale interval, *_e_*

 Value, expressed in units of mass, used for the classification and verification of an instrument.

. Scale interval used for numbering

 Value of the difference between two consecutive numbered scale marks.

. Number of verification scale intervals, *_n_*

 Quotient of the maximum capacity and the verification scale interval:
n = Max / e

. Multi-interval instrument

 Instrument having one weighing range which is divided into partial weighing ranges each with
different scale intervals, with the partial weighing range determined automatically according to the
load applied, both on increasing and decreasing loads.

. Multiple range instrument

 Instrument having two or more weighing ranges with different maximum capacities and different scale
intervals for the same load receptor, each range extending from zero to its maximum capacity.

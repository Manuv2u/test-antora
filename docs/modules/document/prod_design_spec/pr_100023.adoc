== Glossary

=== Weighing instrument

=== Non-automatic weighing instrument


=== Accuracy (_e_)
The difference between the measured and true values. Typically, a manufacturer
will specify a maximum error as the accuracy;

=== Precision
The difference between the instrument's reported values during repeated measurements of the same quantity. Typically, this value is determined by statistical analysis of repeated measurements.

=== Resolution (_d_)
The smallest increment of change in the measured value that can be determined from the instrument's readout scale. The resolution is often on the same order as the precision; sometimes it is smaller.

=== Sensitivity
The change of an instrument or transducer's output per unit change in the measured quantity. A more sensitive instrument's reading changes significantly in response to smaller changes in the measured quantity. Typically, an instrument with higher sensitivity will also have finer resolution, better precision, and higher accuracy.




== Model Specifications of *Prahari-RP*

=== Classification of the Weighing Instrument

*Prahari-RP* is a platform scale which is a  *Non-Automatic Electronic Weighing Instrument*

[qanda]
*The Indicating device is Digital*::
Wherein, the output is not continuous but in steps of scale interval in the form of a sequence of aligned figures. This does not permit interpolation.

 Note: Do not include the note in presentation
 For reference only
 The load cell continuous to measure the change in load, but it will register a value only when a threshold is met. This can be explained by the working principle of A/D Converter. Hence, the wordings, "output is not continuous" and "does not permit interpolation"





*Indication provided by the instrument*::
. An LED is provided to indicate the following states of the weighing instrument.

- The instrument is Powered ON or OFF
- The battery power is low

. A buzzer is provided to indicate the following states of the weighing instrument.

- The instrument is Powered ON
- Buttons are pressed
- Acknowledgment of output during settings

== Principle of Measurement

Figure (*) shows the functional blocks of the weighing scale.

=== Principle of Load transfer
The Single Point - Beam type Load cell, figure 2, is used as the  transducer in the receptor to receive the load, which results in deformation of the load cell. This deformation is captured by the strain gauges which in turn converts the gravitational force into proportionate electrical signal. The signal obtained is a voltage value measured across a Wheatstone Bridge, figure 3. This value is compared against a reference voltage value obtained for a calibrated weight to produce the output.

=== Signal Conditioning
The output of the transducer is first amplified, followed by a filtering stage to remove noise due to power supply and mechanical vibrations. Then this filtered output is sampled by a high resolution ADC. The ADC used is HX711.

=== Units of Measurement
The units of mass used in *Prahari-RP* is

- kilogram (kg)
- milligram (mg )
- gram (g)
- tonne (t)

=== Accuracy Class
*Prahari-RP* is *Class III - Medium Accuracy* weighing instrument.


=== Calibration process

The device is calibrated using a *Reference Weight* and *No Load* condition. At *No Load* condition, the ADC output is recorded keeping an empty pan and the value is set as *ZERO*. A known reference weight (Recommended - 30% of the rated weighing range of the scale) is placed on the pan and the corresponding ADC output is set to the Reference weight value. The slope of the curve is calculated and used as reference for all subsequent measurements.

Accuracy of the slope depends on the True weight used for calibration. During the operation any accumulation of dust, affects the intercept, which will move the curve without affecting the slope.

=== Security

==== Seal
A single bolt with hole in the head connects the interlocked container and cover. A twisted metal wire is passed through the hole and the anchor mount on the cover. A lead block is crimped over the wire to seal the

==== Calibration process

==== Component Replacement

The protection seal is broken to access the internal components. Any component to be replaced have to be made only via breakage of protection seal.


=== Zero Setting and zero tracking Device

There is no zero tracking device provided for *Prahari-RP*.


=== Tare device

There is no preset tare.

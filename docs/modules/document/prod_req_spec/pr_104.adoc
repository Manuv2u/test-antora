=== Accuracy Class III

==== Description and Priority

Weighing scales are divided based on Accuracy classes. Operational parameters are defined based on the Class. Controllers are designed to be **CLASS III** accuracy device.


==== Setting Accuracy

The following procedure is used to determine the accuracy of the weighing scale. The accuracy of weighing scale is defined by the Number of Verification scale as shown in the table below.

.Accuracy Class wrt Verification Scale
|====
.2+^.^|_Accuracy Class_ .2+^.^|_Verification scale interval e_ 2+^.^|_Number if verification scale intervals n = Max/e_ .2+^.^|_Minimum capacity_
^.^|_minimum_ ^.^|_maximum_

^.^|Special I|0.001 g &#8804; e ^.^| 50 000^*^ ^.^| -- ^.^|100e
.2+^.^|High II|0.001 g &#8804; e &#8804; 0.05 g ^.^| 100 ^.^| 100 000 ^.^|20e
|0.1 g &#8804; e  ^.^| 50 000^*^ ^.^| 100 000 ^.^|50e
.2+^.^|Medium III|0.1 g &#8804; e &#8804; 2 g ^.^| 50 000^*^ ^.^| 10 000 ^.^|20e
|5 g &#8804; e ^.^| 50 000^*^ ^.^| 10 000 ^.^|20e
^.^|Ordinary IV|5 g &#8804; e ^.^| 50 000^*^ ^.^| 1000 ^.^|10e
|====

Wherein *_Max_* is the maximum weight to be measured. Hence, considering a scales with max capacities ranging from 50 kg to 500 kg and to fit within the requirement of *_Accuracy Class III_*, different verification scale interval is calculated. Table below lists the minimum and maximum limits for each capacity.

=== Tare and Zero Setting

==== Tare
For the Vibhu based weighing scale, *_Subtractive Tare_* is considered.

==== Zero Setting

The dead pan weight is captured during each startup. It is registered as *ZERO*. The new slope is calculated with the calibrated *LOAD* value to obtain the slope post start up.


=== Security Requirements for Configurations Setting
==== Configuration Settings
Configurations listed below has to be set for the functioning of the weighing scale as designed. The access to controller to set the configuration must be secured from unauthorized access.

. Maximum Capacity of the Weighing Scale
. Verification Scale Interval *_e_* of the Scale
. Designate Controller Serial Number
. Download Events
. Factory Reset


==== Security
Any person access to the controller can edit the values to change the designed characteristics of the Weighing Scale. Any erroneous data entered here can result in the failure of the device to deliver accurate results. Securing these variables is paramount. Each Configuration Change Event must be recorded in the Event Logger. The format for the record in the Event logger must be as shown below

 event count (000 to 999) , parameter ID ,  date and time ,  new value of the parameter

==== Manual Access
The controller can be accessed via 4 button keypad. But for configuration settings, *_manual access is disallowed_*.

==== Wireless Access
Wireless Access is achieved via Bluetooth. The controller is accessed via BT module. The Controller Serial Number is to be used as BT Broadcast ID. To securely access all the levels mentioned in the table below must be cleared.

=== Security Requirements for Calibration
==== Calibration Settings
For the weighing scale to perform accurately, it has to be calibrated to known weight conditions. Any load on the receptor is then either interpolated or extrapolated from the initial conditions. The calibration setting is paramount to the accuracy of the weight measurement. The following procedure should be used to calibrate the Vibhu based Weighing scales.

. Enter Calibration Mode
. Clear the Pan for No Load or Zero setting
. Set a known standardized weight on the pan
. Enter the weight
. Record Calibration Date
. Exit Calibration


==== Security
Any person access to the calibration, erroneous entries leads to false results. Hence, to calibrate the device, security has to be in place, to monitor and control the access to this setting. Both manual and wireless access is allowed to calibrate the device.

==== Manual Access
For Manual access, the following steps are to be followed to calibrate the device.

. Break the Seal to access the Controller.
. Push the spring button on Controller PCB to enter calibration mode
. Enter the 6 digit Passkey via 4 button keypad



==== Wireless Access
Accessed by authorized User via Prahari App.

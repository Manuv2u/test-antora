Kanilebettu Technologies commitment begins with the recognition and acknowledgment that sexual harassment and other types of discriminatory harassment are, of course, unlawful.  We believe that you as a respectable individual can conduct yourself in a professional manner and to show respect for your coworkers, and actively participate in creating a work environment for all employees that is free from sexual harassment and other types of discriminatory harassment.

To reinforce this commitment, Kanilebettu Technologies has developed a policy against harassment and a reporting procedure for employees who have been subjected to or witnessed harassment.  This policy applies to all work related settings and activities, whether inside or outside the workplace, and includes business trips and business related social events.   Use of Kanilebettu Technologies property (e.g. telephones, copy machines, computers, and computer applications such as email and Internet access) to engage in conduct that violates this policy shall attract immediate termination of employment and relevant legal sanctions.

Kanilebettu Technologies policy against sexual harassment prohibits sexual advances or requests for sexual favours or other physical or verbal conduct of a sexual nature, when:

. submission to such conduct is made an express or implicit condition of employment.
. submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting the individual who submits to or rejects such conduct.
. such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an employee’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, humiliating, or offensive working environment.

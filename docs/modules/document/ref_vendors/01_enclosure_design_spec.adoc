== Requirements


. *It must house the following items*
.. 6V Battery
.. Transformer
.. Rocker Switch
.. Push Button
.. Keypad
.. Display x 2 (front and back)
.. Controller
.. Cables
.. Bluetooth Module
.. Metal Round Shell Connector (MRS)
.. LED indicator

. *External connection*
.. Connected to AC mains
.. Load cell connection via MRS

. *Mounting*
.. *Use Case 1:* Platform - Mounted on top of a pole (square pipe with brackets).
.. *Use Case 2:* Table Top/ Bench - Placed next to the weighing pan on the table.
.. *Use case 3:* Open Platform - Mounted underneath the weighing pan.

. *External Attachments*
.. Name Plate
.. Seal wire and Seal

. *Operating Environment*
.. Subjected to rouch handling
.. Prone smear and smudge
.. Possibility of liquid splash
.. Outdoor and dusty environment
.. Indoor and humid environment
.. Direct exposure to sunlight
.. Exposed to Impact loading and Shocks
.. Must be protected against condensation
.. Lower impedance for Bluetooth transmission

. *Others*
.. Aesthetically pleasing
.. Secured tamper-proof assembly
.. Easy to assemble

. *Important decisions from design standpoint*
.. Touch keypad or Mechanical keypad?
.. 6 Digit 7 Segment display - Buy COTS or custom production?
.. Enclosure material selection

. *Notes for Use Case 1*
.. Tare (Push Button) is used frequently
.. 4 keys are required for device settings
.. The weighing scale can be installed at floor level or on a pedestal (approximately 3 ft high), for visibility consideration.
.. The mounting pole can be designed based on the enclosure specification.

. *Notes for Use Case 2*
.. Tare (Push Button) is used frequently
.. Connectors for peripherals (USB + Additional Display + scanners + camera + Barcode scanner)
.. Figure 1 shows the keypad layout for Use Case 2

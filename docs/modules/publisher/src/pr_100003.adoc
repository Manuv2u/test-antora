=== Accuracy Class III

==== Description and Priority

Weighing scales are divided based on Accuracy classes. Operational parameters are defined based on the Class. Controllers are designed to be **CLASS III** accuracy device. In India, *OIML* is the prescribed standard.


==== Setting Accuracy

The following procedure is used to determine the accuracy of the weighing scale.

The accuracy of weighing scale is defined by the Number of Verification scale as shown in the table below.

.Accuracy Class wrt Verification Scale
|====
.2+^.^|_Accuracy Class_ .2+^.^|_Verification scale interval e_ 2+^.^|_Number if verification scale intervals n = Max/e_ .2+^.^|_Minimum capacity_
^.^|_minimum_ ^.^|_maximum_

^.^|Special I|0.001 g &le; e ^.^| 50 000^*^ ^.^| -- ^.^|100e
.2+^.^|High II|0.001 g &le; e &le; 0.05 g ^.^| 100 ^.^| 100 000 ^.^|20e
|0.1 g &le; e  ^.^| 50 000^*^ ^.^| 100 000 ^.^|50e
.2+^.^|Medium III|0.1 g &le; e &le; 2 g ^.^| 50 000^*^ ^.^| 10 000 ^.^|20e

^.^|Ordinary IV|5 g &le; e ^.^| 50 000^*^ ^.^| 1000 ^.^|10e
|====

Wherein *_Max_* is the maximum weight to be measured. Hence, considering a scales with max capacities ranging from 50 kg to 500 kg and to fit within the requirement of *_Accuracy Class III_*, different verification scale interval is calculated. Table below lists the minimum and maximum limits for each capacity.

=== Tare and Zero Setting

==== Tare
For the Ribhu based weighing scale, *_Additive Tare_* is considered. By choice, the 10% of the Max capacity of the weighing scale is to be set as the Max Tare value.

==== Zero Setting

The dead pan weight is to be considered and shall be entered during assembly. The value at which the weight is recorded shall conform not exceed the MPE limits. The value is to be monitored every cycle of measurement and readings exceeding the pre-recorded MPE limits must result in error. And further operation must cease till rectified.

There shall be no zero button to set a value, but shall be recorded only during the time of calibration. During newer calibration process, the *No load* setting must not exceed the previously recorded reference value of  *_Zero Load Value &pm; e_* .

=== Security Requirements for Configurations Setting
==== Configuration Settings
Configurations listed below has to be set for the functioning of the weighing scale as designed. The access to controller to set the configuration must be secured from unauthorized access.

. Maximum Capacity of the Weighing Scale
. Verification Scale Interval *_e_* of the Scale
. Designate Controller Serial Number
. Download Events
. Factory Reset


==== Security
Any person access to the controller can edit the values to change the designed characteristics of the Weighing Scale. Any erroneous data entered here can result in the failure of the device to deliver accurate results. Securing these variables is paramount. Each Configuration Change Event must be recorded in the Event Logger. The format for the record in the Event logger must be as shown below

 event count (000 to 999) , parameter ID ,  date and time ,  new value of the parameter

==== Manual Access
The controller can be accessed via 4 button keypad. But for configuration settings, *_manual access is disallowed_*.

==== Wireless Access
Wireless Access is achieved via Bluetooth. The controller is accessed via BT module. To achieve this link, the all the levels mentioned in the table below must be cleared.

=== Security Requirements for Calibration
==== Calibration Settings
For the weighing scale to perform accurately, it has to be calibrated to known weight conditions. Any load on the receptor is then either interpolated or extrapolated from the initial conditions. The calibration setting is paramount to the accuracy of the weight measurement. The procedure to calibrate the Ribhu based Weighing scale is listed below

. Enter Calibration Mode
. Clear the Pan for No Load or Zero setting
. Compare Previous Record
 - If exists: cannot exceed previous value
    * If value exceeds *_"Zero Load Value &pm; e"_*, display error
 - Else: Record value
. Set a known standardized weight on the pan
. Enter the weight
. Compare Value against previously calibrated result
- If calibration exists: deviation of more than *_MPE_* is disallowed
* If value exceeds *_MPE_*, display error
- Else: Record value
. Exit Calibration

If either of the comparisons fail, then the device is considered to be either physically damaged or pan has been replaced or manipulated. In which case, the device needs to be Factory reset for new calibration, which can be done by authorized user only.

==== Security
Any person access to the calibration, erroneous entries leads to false results. Hence, to calibrate the device, security has to be in place, to monitor and control the access to this setting. Both manual and wireless access is allowed to calibrate the device.

==== Manual Access
For Manual access, the following steps are to be followed to calibrate the device.

. Push the spring button on PCB to enter calibration mode
. Enter the 6 digit Passkey via 4 button keypad



==== Wireless Access
Accessed by authorized User via Prahari App.
